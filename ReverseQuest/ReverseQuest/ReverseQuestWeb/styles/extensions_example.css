/*
This is one of the most useful features of Sass.
Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
It helps keep your Sass very DRY.
In our example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes.

What the above code does is allow you to take the CSS properties in .message and apply them to .success, .error, & .warning.
The magic happens with the generated CSS, and this helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.
This is what it looks like compiled into CSS:

.message, .success, .error, .warning, .success, .error, .warning {
  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
  padding: 10px;

.success {
  border-color: green; }

.error {
  border-color: red; }

.warning {
  border-color: yellow; }
